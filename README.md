## Intro
Run the `runFirst.sh` file to make sure that the necessary programs are installed. The gcloud program will take 5-10 minutes to install for the first time.

There are additional instructions in that file on how to get the google platform to work, but you must have an account at `https://console.cloud.google.com/` and project set up before they will let you use their platform.

The required parameters to run the Google Audio API are in the `midTerm.sh` file.

## Main
Once everything is installed and the audio device is connected you can run the `midTermDemo.sh` file. Press `^C` after recording english after 5 seconds. This will then output what Google thinks you said.
